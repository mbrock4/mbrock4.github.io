<p><i><b> Welcome! </i></p> Skiing has been a large part of my life for the past year, and although I haven't been doing it long, I have come a very long way. It has brought me closer to both sides of my family, and Sugarloaf Mountain has become a place where I want to spend all of my time during the winter. After becoming a better skier, I am now able to fly to Park City, Utah, a few times a year to stay with my family and have a relaxing ski vacation with my cousins. It is a way for me to relieve all of the stress from being a college student while still getting exercise. Two birds one stone!
