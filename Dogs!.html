<p><i><b> Hi! </i></p> Welcome to my favorite page! This page is dedicated to my dog, Baxter, whom I love dearly. He is a four year old maltipoo that is full of energy and is always excited to go on runs with me. Just one of the reasons we get along so well! We like to go on road runs together during the summer and get vanilla ice cream cones afterwards. He has been the perfect addition to our family for the few years he's been with us and I miss him every day while I'm at school. Can't wait until summer break!
