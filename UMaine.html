<p><i><b> Hello again! </i></p> This last page is about my UMaine experience because it has changed my life tremendously. From meeting new friends to exploring my major, coming to college has given me so many opportunities to be myself. So far, I have loved being a Black Bear, as well as being in my major. Going to the UMaine hockey games has been one of my favorite activities, and I have been thinking about joining the club tennis team. Go Bears!
